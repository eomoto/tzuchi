# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  email: "test_1@gmail.com"
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password') %>
  admin: "true"

two:
  email: "test_2@gmail.com"
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password') %>
  admin: "false"
